- make completions sensitive to context (currently, something like 'tail <TAB>'
  and 'tail -n <TAB>' would give the same completion options, although only
  numbers should work in the latter)
- add support for zsh (or rule out the possibility)
- add support for csh (or rule out the possibility)
- add support for ksh (or rule out the possibility)
- add support for fish (or rule out the possibility)
- possibly add a '--_completion_script SHELL_TYPE' option to generate a traditional completion script for the program itself
